# Symbols DB

Tired of having to do a web-search or crawl through outdated menus and apps every time you need to use a symbol like `™`, `©` or [` ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGlBwW7f5HA)?
**Symbols** is a browser-based database, glossary, dictionary thingie that makes it easy to add, lookup and copy symbols to the clipboard!

Links are also supported as symbols. This is especially useful for images, as they will show a preview on hover. Try it with `https://www.nyan.cat/cats/original.gif`!

Limitations:
* Symbols are saved on the browser's local storage, which is limited to a few megabytes (still enough to store millions of total characters).
* Javascript and cookies must be enabled for the page to work properly (`localStorage`requires cookies). This is the default on all browsers.
